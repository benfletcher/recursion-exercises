- Exercise 1: Take an integer as input, and return a boolean indicating whether the value is even or odd.

- Exercise 2: Take an array as input which contains an unknown set of numbers, and output an array which doubles the values of each item in that array. Test your solution by trying a handful of different arrays. Don't worry about error checking to make sure that the array you're given is valid input.

- Exercise 3: Take a string as input, reverse the string, and return the new string.

- Exercise 4: Calculates the nth [triangular number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number).
